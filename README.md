ntyper
======
The start of a small and simple program to aid with touch typing practise by Jack Massey.

Licence
-------
See LICENCE.md

Installation
------------
Use:
  make
This will create bin/typer

Instructions
------------
Run bin/typer to use the program (example.txt must be in the current directory).
Currently the program just runs the generator a number of times to test it. (I know amazing right?)

Future
------
The program will use ncurses for a user interface .
